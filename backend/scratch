control flow?

start static booking -> schedule booking ending -> DONE

start dynamic booking -> run booking extension check              
        booking extension check:
                is user good for the next n minutes?
                yes -> schedule booking extension check in n minutes
                no -> end booking -> DONE

how to cancel midway?
        end booking with id x:
                cancel the scheduled extension check for id x
                        if x is running -> wait for x to finish running and try again
                end booking normally
